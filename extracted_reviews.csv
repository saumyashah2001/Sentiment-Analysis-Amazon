review
They have a nice look and the size is great for individual condiments.
"Great product, great price!"
Love these! Great little dishes and well made.  Wash well in dishwasher.
These are perfect for sauces and condiments. Great size and they are perfect for our needs.
"These dishes are divine. Great for a charcuterie board, to set out at parties or for dipping sauces. Very pleased with purchase."
"They’re small sauce dishes, exactly as they claim to be. Came packaged well, and worked perfectly to hold jam and goat cheese on a charcuterie board I made!"
"These little dishes are perfect for sauces you do not want to run into the rest of plate. We also put several out for dressing sandwiches…ketchup, BBQ, mustard, mayo,  Dishwasher safe. They look expensive and guest will think you went that extra mile. They feel good and sturdy, and bc they are not round I don’t feel as though I would drop one.. We would defining repurchase"
These are cute and the perfect size for my charcuterie board.
"I got these to mix larger amounts of watercolors and these are perfect.  Can leave color in for use next time or clean them out for another color mix.  Much easier to mix on than plastic and are the perfect size, easy to handle."
they are going to work perfectly for my dinner party
Exactly what I needed to finish off my perfect charcuterie party!
"I've discovered I need this size everywhere in the house!  Perfect for snack sizes of seeds and nuts, vitamins, etc., not only for a charceuterie  board(sp?)."
Dog bowls too big? No worries! This soy sauce dish is perfect for tiny pups!
Exactly what I was hoping for when ordered. 10/10

"Love these! I wanted something my 3 year old could use for dipping her chicken nuggets and something beautiful and classy looking to use when hosting. These are both! They are fantastic quality too. Don't pass on these, you'll be sorry!"
"For the price, these dishes are great.  Can you used for soy, dipping sauces, etc.  Highly recommend."
These dishes are perfect for a charcuterie board.
"We'd had them around 3 days when a kid dropped one, and it survived our wood floor. Don't recommend drop kicking one, though."
"Nothing broken, perfect size! Nice!"

"Good product, especially for the price."
For olives..catsup..etc.
"These little ceramic bowls are great! I got them specifically for soy sauce when we have sushi, but quickly realized they're useful for other things, too. For example, my daughter has used them for a little dish of Nutella to dip her pretzels in for a snack. The bowls stack easily and neatly, and take up barely any room in the cupboard. The quality seems great. They came packaged extremely well, too, so there was no problem with shipping. Very pleased with these little bowls!"
These little dishes are the perfect size for dipping sauces. We are a family who loves sauces and condiments but prefer them on the side. The dishes are great for hot or cold items. They are dishwasher and microwave safe. They won’t stain like plastic will with mustard or tomato based products. They are sturdy so I’m not worried about chipping. A great addition to my dinnerware.
"I adore these little dishes. I prefer my dips in a dish so they don't get mixed in with the other food on my plate. I'll usually put this dish on my dinner plate, along side my food. It fits perfect and holds the right amount of sauce or dressing. I love that I can wash them in my dishwasher as well. Definitely recommend."
"These little soy sauce dishes are well made of good quality. The size is great for mixing soy sauce, ginger slices, and vinegar to go with dumplings. Also very good for dipping BBQ sauce when eating air-fryed chicken wings."
"Great bowls for prepping while cooking, dipping, and more. Durable and easy to clean. A staple kitchenware item. Highly recommend"
